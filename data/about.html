    <h1>Reimagining the NYC Subway</h1>
    <p class="description">The subway is integral to New York City, shuttling over 3 million people every day. However, it isn't fully equitable. Often, the communities most in need have the least access to this vital public service.<br>
                            This project analyzes the New York City subway system, identifying inequities and imagining a more equitable and efficient subway system</p>
    <h2>Data Cleansing Pipeline</h2>
    <p class="bodytext">Data used was published through the MTA's Open Data Program. In particular, the <a href = 'https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Hourly-Ridership-Beginning-February-202/wujg-7c2s/about_data'>"MTA Subway Hourly Ridership: Beginning February 2022"</a> was used.
                        As the dataset was very large, python's requests library was used to communicate with the API and obtain data for one day: March 1st, 2023. The data was saved as a CSV. The CSV was then opened using pandas, reformatted so it would be easier to work with and saved in JSON format. In particular, the resulting JSON object containsnested dictionaries of station and time.</p>
