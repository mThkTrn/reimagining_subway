    <h1>SubwAI: Reimagining the NYC Subway</h1>
    <p class="description">The subway is integral to New York City, shuttling over 3 million people every day. However, it isn't fully equitable. Often, the communities most in need have the least access to this vital public service.<br>
                            This project analyzes the New York City subway system, identifying inequities and imagining a more equitable and efficient subway system</p>
